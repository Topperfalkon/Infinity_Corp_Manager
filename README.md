Infinity Corp Manager
=====================

This is a fork of [Topperfalkon's Infinity Corp Manager](http://github.com/Topperfalkon/Infinity_Corp_Manager) project

Infinity Corp Manager
---------------------

Infinity Corp Manager is a PHP and MySQL web application for the organisation of player groups. It is targeted at the community of the upcoming game, [Infinity](#infinity), but is currently a generic community management tool.

Background of this fork
-----------------------

[Topperfalkon](http://github.com/Topperfalkon) started the Infinity Corp Manager project in part to teach himself PHP.
He acknowledged it was a long way off a usable product and released the code under [CC BY-SA-NC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) enabling others to help in the development of the application for the Infinity community.

For the status of Topperfalkon's original repo, see [his readme](https://github.com/Topperfalkon/Infinity_Corp_Manager/blob/master/README.md)

Infinity
-----------------------------

[Infinity](http://www.infinity-universe.com/) is an MMORPG currently in development. It is being built on the [I-Novae Engine](http://www.inovaestudios.com/technology.htm) which offers realistic scale galaxies including real-time seamless transition of the player from planetary surface to outer space.
The game will not have the concepts of 'levels' and 'experience points' common to MMORPGS, instead, the player's real skill will determine their success: Ships will be controlled directly through a first-person perspective.

The game will allow players to form groups or corporations and these are expected to play a massive part in the game, as they do in EVE Online.

System Requirements
-------------------

You'll need the following on your system to run the ICM
* PHP
* MySQL
* An HTTP webserver, like Apache

Installation
------------

It's worth noting that this is very much still not suitable for public use. Only download if you're comfortable with fiddling with code.

1. Upload to web server under the document root.
2. Open /install.php in your browser and follow the instructions.
3. That should be it. Navigate to /index.php, create a user, and get cracking.
